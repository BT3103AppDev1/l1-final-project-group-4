# Paws & Pampers

## Description

Paws & Pampers is a web application designed to centralize and streamline the entire booking and scheduling process for a dog grooming business. The application allows customers to book appointments online, and the admin can view these bookings online and assign groomers to them. Employees can then view their tasks from their own accounts, which enhances productivity by removing the need for unnecessary communication.

The web application includes unique features that alleviate common pain points for dog owners and businesses. For example, it provides live-updates of the dog grooming process, so that customers no longer have to worry about being late to pick their dog up and can run their errands at ease. As for the business, the website completely digitalizes business processes, as administrative matters can be done with a few clicks of a button, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
